## Udacity Project
Intro to iOS App Development with Swift is a lesson that I have learned to build Pitch-Perfect. Build my first app with Swift and Xcode, Appleâ€™s programming environment for app development. I learn how to use AutoLayout, UIButtons, and UILabels to create an interface, and how to react to touch events in an app using ViewController and multiple views. I also learn how to set up audio recording and playback in a voice recording app.
