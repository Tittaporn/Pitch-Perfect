# Pitch-Perfect
This is an iPhone app that will alllow users to record their voice and will then modulate ther recorded audio to sound like a. Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

## Udacity Project
Intro to iOS App Development with Swift is a lesson that I have learned to build Pitch-Perfect. Build my first app with Swift and Xcode, Appleâ€™s programming environment for app development. I learn how to use AutoLayout, UIButtons, and UILabels to create an interface, and how to react to touch events in an app using ViewController and multiple views. I also learn how to set up audio recording and playback in a voice recording app.
